## My Top 3 favorite cmd commands
&nbsp;
### 1. mkdir — Create a directory
---
``` mkdir ``` is a useful command you can use to create directories. Any number of directories can be created simultaneously which can greatly speed up the process.

>* Syntax: ```mkdir``` [option(s)] directory_name(s)
>* Common options: -m, -p, -v
---

### 2. ls — List directory contents
---
``` ls ``` is probably the most common command. A lot of times, you’ll be working in a directory and you’ll need to know what files are located there. The ls command allows you to quickly view all files within the specified directory.

>* Syntax: ``` ls ``` [option(s)] [file(s)]
>* Common options: -a, -l
---

### 3. touch — Creates a file
---
``` touch ``` is going to be the easiest way to create new files, but it can also be used to change timestamps on files and/or directories. You can create as many files as you want in a single command without worrying about overwriting files with the same name.

>* Syntax: ``` touch ``` [option(s)] file_name(s)
>* Common options: -a, -m, -r, -d
